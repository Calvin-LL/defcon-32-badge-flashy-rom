## How to flash

If you can't write to your SD card and don't mind losing the current firmware, you can flash the badge with the `rom-firmware.uf2` file.

1. Power off the badge
2. Plug in a USB cable into a computer
3. Hold the top right button on the back of the badge while plugging the USB cable into the badge

4. The badge should show up as a USB drive on your computer, drag the `rom-firmware.uf2` file onto the drive
5. Wait for the badge to reboot
6. Enjoy the flashing lights!

## How to build

1. Download gbdk from https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020
2. Run
   ```bash
   ./gbdk/bin/lcc -o flashy.gb ./src/main.c

   (replace `./gbdk` with the path to your gbdk directory)
3. The `flashy.gb` file is the ROM that you can add to the SD card, or you can make a firmware with https://defrom.lol/
