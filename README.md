## How to flash

If you can't write to your SD card and don't mind losing the current firmware, you can flash the badge with the `rom-firmware.uf2` file.

1. Power off the badge
2. Plug in a USB cable into a computer
3. Hold the top right button on the back of the badge while plugging the USB cable into the badge

5. Wait for the badge to reboot

## How to build

1. Download gbdk from https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020
2. Run
   ```bash
   ./gbdk/bin/lcc -Wm-yC -o flashy.gbc ./src/main.c
